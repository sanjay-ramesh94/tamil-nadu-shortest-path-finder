# Tamil Nadu Shortest Path Finder

This project is a Python implementation of **Dijkstra's Algorithm** to compute the shortest path between districts in Tamil Nadu. It provides an efficient solution to determine the minimal travel distance and path across various districts, showcasing key features like performance tracking and step-by-step route computation.

## 🚀 Features
- Calculate the shortest distance between two districts.
- Display the complete path from the source to the destination.
- Provides the total distance, number of nodes traversed, and execution time.
- Handles cases with missing or invalid districts gracefully.
- Designed with an example graph of Tamil Nadu districts (may not reflect real-world accuracy).

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tamil-nadu-shortest-path-finder.git


📋 How to Use
Enter the starting district when prompted.
Enter the ending district.
The program calculates:
The shortest distance (in kilometers).
The exact path connecting the districts.
The total number of nodes in the path.
Execution time for the algorithm.


Enter the starting district: Chennai
Enter the ending district: Madurai
Shortest distance from Chennai to Madurai: 347 km
Path: Chennai -> Vellore -> Dharmapuri -> Salem -> Namakkal -> Karur -> Tiruchirappalli -> Madurai
Number of nodes in path: 8
Time taken: 0.00045 seconds

📚 Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher
🏗️ Built With
Python - For implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm.
Heapq - For priority queue functionality to optimize pathfinding.
